# GraphQL Persisted Queries Demo

This tech demo demonstrates how publicly exposed GraphQL APIs can be protected
from arbitrary queries using persisted queries (white/-allowlisting).
Persisted queries are generally easier to implement correctly compared to
[query complexity analysis](https://gqlgen.com/reference/complexity/)
(more about the topic here:
[howtographql.com - security](https://www.howtographql.com/advanced/4-security/)).

Queries are defined in `backend/persisted_queries`
as `<name>.graphql` files. This directory will be watched by the server
hot-reloading the persisted queries without downtime.
Ð•ach query can then be executed via its name: `POST /e/<name>`.
If necessary, variables are to be provided as a JSON object
in the request body with the `Content-Type: encoding/json` header.

`GQL_PQ_MODE="ON_INIT"` disables hot-reloading of persisted queries.

with `MODE="DEBUG"` the server exposes direct querying via `/query` and the
GraphiQL playground via `/` as well as the persisted queries under `/e/`.
`MODE="PRODUCTION"` will only make the persisted query endpoints available
making sure clients can't execute arbitrary queries.

# Workflow 

Frontend developers add their queries to `backend/persisted_queries` to allow their
frontend application to call the API in production. Backend developers
are expected to review and control the persisted queries.
